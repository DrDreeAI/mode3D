## Quick orientation for AI coding agents

This is a Unity 6 (Editor 6000.2.8f1) project with C# scripts under `Assets/` and package-managed dependencies in `Packages/manifest.json`.

Key facts you can rely on:
- Unity Editor version: 6000.2.8f1 (ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt). Target build in `.csproj` is StandaloneOSX.
- Project C# target: netstandard2.1, C# 9.0 (see `Assembly-CSharp.csproj`). Do not change generated `.csproj` directly.
- Main custom scripts live under `Assets/_Project/` (e.g., `Assets/_Project/Scripts/DatePickerUI.cs`). TextMesh Pro examples and XR samples are included.
- Important packages: Input System (`com.unity.inputsystem`), XR Interaction Toolkit (`com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit`), OpenXR, URP, Unity Test Framework. One package (`com.gamelovers.mcp-unity`) is referenced via a git URL.

What to do first when making code changes
- Open the project in the exact Unity editor referenced above (Unity Hub preferred). Many files (Packages & project settings) are managed by the editor.
- Do not hand-edit auto-generated files under the root `.csproj` or the `Library/` folder — they are regenerated by Unity.
- When adding new C# scripts, place them under `Assets/_Project/Scripts/` following the existing namespace-free style used in current scripts.

Patterns & integration points to follow
- Platform-specific behavior: look for `#if UNITY_EDITOR`, `#elif UNITY_ANDROID`, etc. Example: `DatePickerUI.OpenPicker()` simulates input in editor but calls an `AndroidDatePicker` bridge on Android; native bridges are likely under `Assets/Plugins/Android` or provided by packages.
- UI uses TextMesh Pro (many examples under `Assets/TextMesh Pro/Examples & Extras`). Prefer TMP types (e.g., `TMP_InputField`) for UI inputs.
- XR code and samples live under `Assets/XRI` and related packages. When touching XR flows, check `Packages/` versions to avoid API drift.

Build / test / debug notes
- Use the Unity Editor Test Runner for play/edit mode tests (package `com.unity.test-framework`).
- Headless CLI builds (example) — run from macOS with the editor binary used in the `.csproj` analyzers path. Example pattern (adjust path/version to match local Unity installation):
  /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.2.8f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity -batchmode -projectPath <repo-root> -buildTarget StandaloneOSX -executeMethod <YourBuildMethod> -quit
- To regenerate IDE project files, open Unity and use Assets -> Open C# Project (or enable auto-regenerate in Preferences). Avoid manual edits to generated csproj files.

Conventions specific to this repo
- Folder prefixes: `_Project/` for in-house code, `_ThirdParty/` for vendored content. Follow those placements.
- Many example/example-asset files are kept under `Assets/TextMesh Pro/Examples & Extras` — copy patterns when adding TMP-based components.
- Native plugin expectations: when C# calls platform-native functionality (like `AndroidDatePicker`), search `Assets/Plugins` or `Packages` for the native bridge implementation.

When editing or extending code, include these small checks in your PRs
1. Confirm the change compiles in the Unity Editor version in ProjectVersion.txt.
2. If you add package dependencies, update `Packages/manifest.json` only via Unity's Package Manager (preferred) or document the change clearly.
3. Run any existing tests via the Test Runner and record results in the PR description.

Files to inspect for context/examples
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` — editor version.
- `Packages/manifest.json` — package list & external git refs.
- `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` — shows target framework and compile include list (auto-generated).
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/DatePickerUI.cs` — small example of platform-specific guard usage and TMP fields.

If anything above is ambiguous or you need more examples (native plugin, build scripts, or contributor conventions), tell me which area to expand and I'll add concise, targeted guidance.
